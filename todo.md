- [ ] Create upload history UI component
- [ ] Test authentication flow with real uploads

## Phase 2: New Features (Current)
- [x] Create Admin Dashboard for user and upload management
- [x] Write comprehensive Admin Dashboard documentation (Admin_Dashboard_Guide.md)
- [x] Implement admin router with full test coverage (15 passing tests)
- [x] Implement Upload History UI sidebar component
- [x] Add "Connect Dotloop" button with OAuth placeholder modal
- [x] Integrate database-backed upload history with frontend
- [x] Test all three new features together

## Phase 3: Dotloop API Integration (Future)

- [ ] Implement tenant isolation in queries
- [ ] Create brokerage management interface
- [ ] Test data isolation between brokerages

## Phase 3: CSV Robustness & Testing
- [x] Analyze current CSV parsing logic and identify vulnerabilities
- [x] Implement advanced CSV validation (encoding, delimiters, malformed data)
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling with recovery options
- [x] Create test suite with 37 edge cases (all passing)
- [x] Implement file size limits (50MB) and performance optimization
- [x] Add user-friendly error reporting with ValidationErrorDisplay component
- [x] Create CSV compatibility documentation (CSV_ROBUSTNESS_GUIDE.md)
- [x] Integrated validation into upload flow with error dialog

## Phase 4: Upload Progress Tracking
- [x] Create UploadProgress component with multi-stage progress bars

- [x] Verified all three stages work correctly (validation, parsing, upload)

## Phase 5: Performance Metrics Dashboard
- [x] Design database schema for performance metrics (processing times, file sizes)
- [x] Add performance tracking fields to uploads table (fileSize, validationTimeMs, parsingTimeMs, uploadTimeMs, totalTimeMs, status)
- [x] Create admin API endpoints for aggregate statistics (8 endpoints with 9 passing tests)
- [x] Build Performance Metrics Dashboard page (admin-only at /performance)
- [x] Add charts for file size distribution
- [x] Add charts for processing time trends
- [x] Add success/failure rate metrics
- [x] Add bottleneck identification (slowest stages)
- [x] Integrate performance tracking into upload flow
- [x] Test with real upload data
